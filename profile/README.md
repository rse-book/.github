## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the *rse-book* GitHub organization. The idea of the project is to enable researchers and business analysts to leverage their field specific expertise with the help of the open source ecosystem. 

This organization contains repositories from ideas and drafts to demo data, source code and useful resources. 
Most importantly it's home to the book project *Research Software Engineering - A Guide to the Open Source Ecosystem*. 

The 2022 edition of the course [Hacking for Science](http://www.vorlesungsverzeichnis.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lang=en&lerneinheitId=161937&semkez=2022W&ansicht=LEHRVERANSTALTUNGEN&) used the RSE book as a primary resource.
The course was taught at ETH Zurich in fall 2022.
